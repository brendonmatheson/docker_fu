# How to Use

Sessions based on this material are in two formats:

- **Presentations** - a lecture with demonstrations of Docker throughout


- **Workshops** - a hands-on practical session where participants are guided through a series of exercises on their own laptops

If you are an attendee to an upcoming hands-on workshop session, or if you are working through the practical exercises after joining a presentation or workshop session, then:

- Pre-cache the images that you'll be working with by:
  - Ensure Docker is set to Linux Containers
  - At a command prompt or Powershell window run pull_all_linux.cmd.  This may take minutes to even an hour or two to pull all the image data, depending on the speed of your Internet connection
  - Once that script is finished, switch Docker to Windows Containers
  - Back at the command prompt or Powershell window run pull_all_windows.cmd.  Again this may take time to complete because it will be pulling several gigabytes of Docker images to your local cache

# Sessions

The contents of this repo are branched for each session that was given.  You can get the slides for the session you
